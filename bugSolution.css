The solution involves using more precise selectors to target specific elements and adjusting the box model properties. We avoid using both absolute and relative positioning within the same element hierarchy. The solution also introduces a clear separation of styles for better maintainability and prevents unexpected conflicts. Instead of margins and paddings, we use absolute positioning in combination with top, left, right, and bottom properties to ensure exact element placement without conflict.
